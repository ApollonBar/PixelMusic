# Pixel Player

This is a beautiful **unofficial NetEase Cloud music player** on Android ðŸ¥³! Thanks to the KMM and
Compose, I planned to support more platforms such as MacOS, Windows 10, Linux in the near future.

**Note:** This project is still in progress, which means it has instability. The features are poor
now and animations may be not fluent enough.

* I'm so sorry that my application **cannot run on the devices below Android 7**. I temporarily
  adjusted the min sdk version to 24. If you have the crash log on those devices, please send to me,
  so I will be able to resolve the annoying crashes, thank you.

* I won't provide any packages during this **Pre-Alpha stage** due to the instability, you can build
  it in person. Welcome to report issues and pull request.

## Technical features

* **Kotlin** 1.4.30-RC
* **Androidx** Snapshot [7113967](https://androidx.dev/snapshots/builds/7113967/artifacts)
* **Jetpack Compose** Snapshot (1.0.0-alpha12)
