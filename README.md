# Pixel Music

This is a beautiful **unofficial NetEase Cloud music player** for Android ðŸ¥³!

**Notice:**

* This project is still in progress, which means it is unstable. The features are poor now and
  animations may not be fluent enough.

* I'm so sorry that my application **cannot run on the devices below Android 7**. I temporarily
  adjusted the min sdk version to 24. If you have the crash log on those devices, please send to me,
  so I will be able to resolve the annoying crashes, thank you.

* I won't provide any packages during this **Pre-Alpha stage** due to the instability, you can build
  it in person. Welcome to report issues and pull request.
