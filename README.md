# Pixel Music

This is a beautiful **unofficial NetEase Cloud music player** for Android ðŸ¥³!

**Notice:**

* This project is still **in progress**, which means it is unstable. The features are poor now and
  animations may not be fluent enough.

* I'm so sorry that my application **cannot run on the devices below Android 7**. I temporarily
  adjusted the min sdk version to 24. If you have the crash log on those devices, please send to me,
  so I will be able to resolve the annoying crashes, thank you.
